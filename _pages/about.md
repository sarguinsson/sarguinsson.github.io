Hi! I’m Arnau, a Software Developer at [The Project Group](https://www.theprojectgroup.com/en/) and also a Basketball coach at [Bàsquet Girona](https://basquetgirona.com/). I’m an intrepid person with some little experience in programming, but ready too have fun and make some noise.

I like to play around with different programming languages, and bring them to amateur personal projects related to sports, social activities and others. My main interests include all sports, but mainly basketball, and regarding al fields that might include, particularly analytics. As Golden State Warriors would say, [Strength in Numbers!](https://www.nba.com/warriors/numbers).

## My background and history

I hold a undergraduate degree in Building Engineering from [University of Girona](https://www.udg.edu/en/) (**2008 - 2012**) and a Software Engineering degree from [Open University of Catalunya](https://www.uoc.edu/portal/en/index.html) (**2013 - 2018**). For about six years I was working as a Building Engineer as freelance and in different companies. But after some time combining my work and software enginering studies, I saw that I wanted to go into this new technologies world, so I decided to make some changes in my life and jump into the wheel of new technologies.

Regarding to Sports, I have always been playing basketball, and at the young age of 15 I started my path as a coach, and still here I am! You can find some more information in [Coaching's Tab]({% link _pages/coaching.md %}).
