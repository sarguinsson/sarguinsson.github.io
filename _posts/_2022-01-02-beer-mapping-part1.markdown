Recently, there was a discusion into my close circle of friends about beer price in our hometown Girona. So I decided to start a little research on this topic, to bring strong arguments into next meeting and taking advantadge on my software skills. I decided to get into map data visualization. In this article we will walk through diferent kinds of datasets to display bar locations and zones with higher rate of bars.

## Datasets

Before starting to draw maps, I'll explain the used datasets for this blog entry. The datasets url are specified in references part.

To get all the bars I used "activitats2020_bars.csv" which is a filtered csv with all the activities that rerference a Bar in Girona.

- Activities file (.csv)

Also whith friends we are feeding an Mongo DB with bars and prices

For neighbourhood shapes it's being used:

- Neigbourhoods shapes zip file --> that includes

  - .shp
  - .dbf
  - .sbn
  - .sbx
  - .shp.xml
  - .shx

## Display bar locations with points

```python
import folium
import pandas as pd
import pymongo

input_nbh_shp = "./Barris.shp"
input_activities = "./activities2020_bars.csv"

nbh_sbh_df = gpd.read_file(input_nbh_shp)
act_df = gpd.read_file(input_activities)

nbh_sbh_df = nbh_sbh_df.to_crs(epsg=4236)

center = [41.97969558739158, 2.8213967358161915]
```

## Display neighbourhoods with bar sum

```python
import folium
import pandas as pd
import pymongo

input_nbh_shp = "./Barris.shp"
input_activities = "./activities2020_bars.csv"

nbh_sbh_df = gpd.read_file(input_nbh_shp)
act_df = gpd.read_file(input_activities)

nbh_sbh_df = nbh_sbh_df.to_crs(epsg=4236)

center = [41.97969558739158, 2.8213967358161915]
```
